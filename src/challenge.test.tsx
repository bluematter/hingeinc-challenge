   *
   * Hint: The async ID for the delayIncrement action creator is `delay-increment`.
   *
   * Bonus 1: When the increment is complete, use an AsyncTracker callback to emit a log message with whatever you like.

   *
   * Bonus 3: Make the test run faster by using Jest's timer mocks.

 *
 * - All tests must still pass (it is OK to modify the tests a bit to accomodate changes in the DOM structure).
 * - Feel free to add new elements for layout/style, but don't add any extra functionality beyond the counter.
 * - The layout must be responsive from 420px wide all the way to 1080p.
